# toy-projects
These are some of the small coding projects I played around with to practice python.
I made all of these for fun. They help me explore the different ways I can use python to display the behavior of physical systems and do numerical computations.

I plotted a histogram of a normal gaussian distribution! In purple!

Here is the plot I made of the trajectory of a free falling projectile:

This is the plot of an the probability distribution of energy quanta on side A for two Einstein solids in thermal contact:
